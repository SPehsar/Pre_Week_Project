        <p> 
            Apart from eating cookies and loving chocolate, I have always had this passion to learn and grow. Along which I will be able to </br> 
            utilize my knowledge to design, architect, and build; to innovate. With regard to programming, I have taken various courses long ago, </br> 
            but I never used one due to my work position that did not require it.  Nowadays, you know how to fit in. In addition, learning to </br> 
            code teaches us abstract thinking and problem-solving, which are, in fact, key to becoming a successful computer programmer. Of course, </br> 
            we will also need to know some coding languages to apply your knowledge.  I had this in my mind that I needed to use what I had learned. </br>  
            It took a while for me to reach this point.   In addition, learning to code teaches us abstract thinking and problem-solving, which are, </br>

            So why does computer programming have such a glow for me? Here they are:</br> 
            <ul> 
                <li>Grow in our current job</li>
                <li>Enhance wer marketability for a new job
                If we want to work in technology, our coding skill set may be sufficient to get a job</br> 
                without a bachelor's degree. we can enhance our resume even without a degree by earning certificates or diplomas.</li>
                <li> Increase our income</li>
                <li> Work from home</li>
                <li>Improve our efficiency
                With programming skills, we can potentially design applications that allow we to be a more efficient employee. </br> 
                We can write code to automate processes that we do regularly, allowing our computer to work in the background while we </br>
                focus on tasks that require human input.</li>
                <li>Start our own business</li>
                <li> Develop problem-solving skills</li>
                <li> Develop and improve our logic, reasoning, and problem-solving skills</li>

                <li>Improve our attention to detail</li> 

                <li>Build perseverance and grow our creativities
                We can generate code from nothing, starting with only our goals for the final product.  </br> 
                Because code is dependent on accuracy, we may experience incorrect coding. When errors occur, we usually have to think about possible </br>
                sources and look for and identify them to find ways to correct them. Although this process can take time, it can help teach us </br> 
                not to give up during difficult situations. In this way, we can develop a habit of keeping a positive mindset despite challenges.
                </li>

        </ul>  
        Education and learning will never stop there, since I am a lifetime learner, I love learning to improve bit by bit and day by day. </br> 
        It is my passion to learn about dots and connecting them. </br>
